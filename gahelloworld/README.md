# Genetic Algorithm Hello World! (Java Edition)

This is a simple project intended to showcase genetic algorithms with a well 
known example for all new developers; namely the classic "Hello, world!" 
example, written in Java.

## Overview

The application simply "evolves" the string "Hello, world!" from a population 
of random strings.  It is intended to be a gentle introduction into the world
of genetic algorithms, specifically with Java.  The program itself is really 
simple, and spans 3 classes.  Only two of them do any real interesting work;
the third one, <i>GAHelloWorld</i>, only exists as a driver for the 
application.

## Usage

The project currently uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) for the build.
To build it locally, run the following from a shell:

> mvn clean install

To execute the simulation, change to the <i>target</i> directory and run:

> java -jar gahelloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
